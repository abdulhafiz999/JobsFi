## ðŸš€ Overview

JobsFi allows employers to post job listings and applicants to apply, all on-chain.  
Our current MVP (Minimum Viable Product) supports:

- Smart contract-based job posting
- Subscription model for job access (APE payments)
- On-chain job storage via IPFS (basic but functional)
- Transparent interaction without central control
